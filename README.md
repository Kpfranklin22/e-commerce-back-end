## Installation

The following dependencies must be installed to run the application: MySQL2, Express, Dotenv, and Sequelize

## Usage

To use this application you must be able to log in to your MySql account through the command line to source the schema. Then you must use the command 'npm run seed" to download the database information. After sourcing the schema and seeding the database you must use the command 'npm run watch" to connect to the server and constantly update the server with nodemon. Once your server is up and running you must use either Insomnia or Postman to check your API endpoints and make sure everything is working correctly.
